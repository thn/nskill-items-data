## This repository is now READ ONLY.

Updates to this repository are no longer being accepted. There are sites out there using the
[THN Item DB API] which is an up to date source of items data for [Neocron Evolution] and with correct (Or not!)
resists and armour calculations.

This repository is being marked as read only to allow Neocron players to clone it and use it. If you do decide
to do something crazy with this repository, let us know on [Twitter].

A big thanks goes to all the NSkill authors for writing this utility for the Neocron Community.

## Using NSkill

Due to regional variation on how to handle decimal places, you must rename the items folder.

## US and UK Users

if you use 1.00 to represent a two digit decimal place number please rename.

items-en to items, 

## Germany and other European Users

if you use 1,00 to represent a two digit decimal place number please rename.

items-eu to items

Otherwise NSkill will default to using its internal values, and it'll appear you can't edit anything.

And yes, globalization would make so much more sense, but this was made way before that occurred to me D

Always best to edit these values with NSkill closed down, and reload when you're done.

Have fun.
